io_box.txt - notes to self on the box with the TS-7200 card and the (2) 20 port IO cards

procedure for testing/debugging io box:

1)  recompile the sched program in thread_io so that the serial port is at 115200.
	(see serial_io.c - MODEMDEVICE)
	
2)  uncomment (or add) any printf statements in either tasks.c or cmd_tasks.c
	(usually the printf("cmd: %d %s\r\n",cmd,cmd_array[cmd].cmd_str); in cmd_tasks.c
	just before the main tcp loop)
	
3)  recompile and upload to the io box using the correct ip address.

4)  plug the DB-9 serial output of the io box to a terminal program running on windows or linux.

5)  reboot the io box (turn it off and back on) and be ready to hit 'Ctl-C' when it 
	starts coming up. (start hitting 'Ctl-C' several times)
	
6)  when it says "<Redboot>" type in "fis load vmlinux" and hit return.

7)  then type in: exec -c "S console=ttyAM0,115200 root=/dev/mtdblock" and hit return

8)  it will reboot and when it comes up to shell and asks for a login, type "root" and
	hit enter.

9)  then change to directory /home/dan/dev/sched and rename try_sched.sh to anything
	(usually just "ls -ltr")

10) then issue the command: "reboot" and it will reboot and execute the try_sched.sh script.

11) you can then check for the new sched program which should be in /root and execute
	it by changing to the sched directory and typing "do1.sh" which will move /root/sched 
	to the /home/dan/dev/sched directory, change the permissions and execute it. 
	(do2.sh will execute the sched program already in the sched directory)


Relays on IO cards are 5A so use 5v power from separate DC-DC converter as coil voltage for 10A 
relay arrays. (note: DO NOT use 5v from inside box - if you happen to short the 5v to gnd or
even worse, 12v you can screw up the cards inside the box - this cost me a day or so of trouble-
shooting and rewiring the io box)

format of O_DATA in thread_io/queue/ollist_thread_rw.h

typedef struct o_data
{
	char label[OLABELSIZE];
	UCHAR port;
	UCHAR onoff;			// current state: 1 if on; 0 if off
	UCHAR input_port;		// input port which affects this output (if not set to 41)
	UCHAR polarity;			// 0 - on input turns output on; off input turns output off
							// 1 - on input turns output off; off input turns output on
	UCHAR type;				// see below
	UINT time_delay;		// when type 2-4 this is used as the time delay
	UINT time_left;			// gets set to time_delay and then counts down
	UCHAR pulse_time;		// not used
	UCHAR reset;			// used to make 2nd pass
} O_DATA;

type:
0) regular - on/off state responds to assigned input (affected_output)
1) goes on/off and stays that way until another on/off
2) on for time_delay seconds and then it goes back off
3) goes on/off every second until time_delay is up
4) if on, turn off and wait for msg (serial or tcp) to turn back on
6) goes on/off at pulse_time rate in 10ths of a second then
	goes off when time_delay is up
7) goes on/off at pulse_rate in 10ths of a second if onoff is 
	active only (not implemented yet)

type 6 & 7 not implemented yet

reset is used when type is 1 and 2: when type 1 it sets reset on the 1st pass
and then on 2nd pass it will change the output - 2 for time delay - there is
a loop in the timer task which checks all the output records for type 2 and
counts down using the time_left field.

When input_port field is set to anything less than 40, then this refers to the
input port which triggers the output - e.g. port 0 turns on/off the headlights,
so both LHEADLAMP and RHEADLAMP are activated by a switch going to port 0.

monitor_input_task() does the scanning of the actual input ports and changes the outputs to
whatever the physical switch is set to, depending on the type.

monitor_fake_input_task() scans an array called fake_inportstatus1 & 2 set by change_inputs()
so the outputs can be set programatically

#use this for TS-7200
CC_FLAGS = -static -g -DMAKE_TARGET -Wstrict-prototypes -mcpu=arm920t
#use this for TS-7800

8/8/18 - getting intermittent segment fault when doing change_output() - seems to
happen more often when doing using tcp command but never does it from within
monitor_input_task ~? - something flakey about card 146 - 149 works ok

8/13/18 - thread_io was causing segment fault crash because when live window was up there was some
un received tcp messages so I set the get_sock call in tcp_win2 to non-blocking and that seemed to 
fix it.

9-14-18 - added a new type to O_DATA (type 4) to be used as a lockout relay. The E-Stop switch is connected
to port 19 and affects outputs 1 & 2 (ignition and fuel pump). The types for 1 & 2 are set to type 4
so when the E-Stop switch is pressed it will turn then off so they stay off unless a special message
(_RESET_TYPE4) is sent which resets the reset field to 0. They have to be turned on not by using the 
change_input but change_output function.

Then a msg will be sent to the PIC24 that tells it that the E-Stop button was pressed so it can ask 
for the password to be re-entered or shutdown everything.

in tasks.c serial_recv_task() if byte recv'd is RT_DATA then recv the ADC channels
from the PIC24 which are sent from send_comm1

tasks.c sends data to PIC24 using write_serial at several places prefixed by the commands:
CLEAR_SCREEN
GET_DEBUG_INFO
GET_DEBUG_INFO2
OUTPUT_MSG
these all must be a total of 5 bytes including the command - they are received by recv_comm1
in the PIC24

todo: (x) = done

-  need a way to save the odometer reading to disk.

-  get rpm/mph data sent to comm3 of PIC24 (x)
-  thread_io just sends current time once a minute or 30 minutes - PIC24 keeps track of time with timer_task
-  setup spare AVR to generate sample rpm/mph signals to test LEDs
-  fix problem with client - host open, edit and save file (x)
-  only I_DATA type that explicitly turns on and off is type 2 & 3 (time delay). If set to toggle
	then polarity feature could be implemented but the current IO settings would have to be set
	initially after loading the db and the db would have to be save on exit
-  wired 1st 2 relays as left br/dim and right br/dim (nc = dim) and 3rd & 4th relays as
	left & right headlamps - common of 1st 2 comes from no of next 2 - dim is nc on 1st 2 so make
	changes accordingly in the O_DATA.
-  instead of using hard-coded output/input types in mytypes.h as indexes into llist functions, 
	have some way to read what's in the odata.dat file incase it changes, otherwise, the sched has
	to be recompiled whenever the database changes. (basic_controls function in tasks.c is the
	only place that has that problem)	

TS-7200 has a config file called param.conf that it loads on startup. As soon as the client logs in,
the TS-7200 sends the current config data and the client can edit it and send it back. When the
client closes the dialog to edit the config data, it sends a SET_PARAMS message which saves the
data to disk and also sends a message to the PIC24 (SEND_PARAMS) with the config data which 
pertains to it - temp settings for cooling fan and blower fan.

Work-around for tail-light delima:
The tail light has 2 filements: 1 dim and 1 bright. The dim is one of the running-lights. So
what happens if you press on the brakes and the blinkers at the same time? There are 2 outputs
for each tail-light, blinker and brake. When the brakes are on the blinker is supposed to
flash the bright while the other brake stays on. So make the inputs to the blinkers reference
an additional ouput which goes to a coil which shuts off the brake light relay so the blinker
can flash it. This entails using 3 relays for each tail-light. (see blinker_ctl.jpg)
The database solution would be to have another field which port to override if it is on.
This could have easily been hard-coded in the software but I wanted to avoid as much
"if-then-else" spagetti code as possible.
But now the problem is that we need a sep. relay for the front blinker or else when the brakes
are on the front as well as the rear blinker (or high bulb stay on) because I was using the
same left and right relays for the front and rear blinkers. So I ended up using 3 relays for
the rear blinker/brakelight and another for the front blinker. (ports 8->15)
