The LCD screen is plugged into the board with the PIC24. The board with the PIC24 has the
board for the FPGA plugged into the back of it. The PIC24 board has the drivers for converting
3v3 to 5v TTL going to the LCD screen. The board for LCD also has the keypad which has pins
which plug into the PIC24 board which are passed to the FPGA board. 

LCD screen (front panel) <- drivers <- PIC24
keypad (front panel) -> PIC24 board -> FPGA
PIC24 -> (SPI signals) -> FPGA
FPGA -> drivers -> LED's for mph & rpm (front panel)
PIC24 <-> FPGA (extra signals for future use)
PIC24 -> (2) UARTS: 1 to the TS-5500 and one for a monitor

The front panel will also have 3 small LED's: 2 for right & left blinker (red & green)
and a blue one in the middle for brights. These can either be commands sent via SPI or
separate lines. The FPGA board will have drivers plus the hw to drive the LED's and use
extra pins from the PIC24 to the front panel.

The pins on the PIC24 for hooking up the programmer will have to be sawed off and another
connector routed to the outside for hooking up the PIC programmer. The ICD ribbon connector
for programming the FPGA will be facing the outside or re-routed to another ICD plug.
The outside will also have the (2) DB-9 connectors for the comm ports.
There also needs to be connectors for the PIC24 to read the other sensors like the temp
sensors, water temp, oil pressure and rpm & mph.
