Main Box to house STM32 chip and keypad 

Screen Box has the AVR & LCD screen (in sep. panel to left above red & green buttons)

This box replaces the old monster box which housed the screen, keypad, AVR, PIC24FJ and the FPGA boards.
The main box connects to the screen box via an RS-232 cable using 3v3->5v & RS-232 converters
There is also a PWM wire (screen dim) from the STM32 to the screen box (or use the PWM on from the FPGA)

The AVR and screen work as before and are connected the same, but an STM32 Discovery board replaces the
Microchip PIC24FJ128.

The FPGA board will be the Main Box and will use a parallel port to send data to the STM32 and
use a serial recv line with same handshacking lines as before. (UART3)

serial ports on STM32:

UART1: monitor/TS-7200 (external)
UART2: AVR (external)
UART3: FPGA (external with 2 handshaking lines)
note: UART3 RX is not used, instead, there is a parallel port used.
		Also, the UART3 TX uses (2) handshacking lines (CS & ACK)

FPGA -> STM32:
rpm/mph data
STM32 -> FPGA:
cmds to FPGA

TS-7200 -> STM32:

STM32 -> TS-7200:
cmds from keypad
engine temp from DS1620 task 
rt values (rpm/mph) from recv FPGA task

Since the UART receive's are in queues, they can
only transfer 8 bytes at a time, so the TS-7200 UART
could just use buffers protected by mutexes but can
the FreeRTOS mutexes be called from without the 
FreeRTOS tasks, or just ordinary functions?

The STM32 has up to 16 ADC channels but the FPGA can be used to do the ADC using support chips.

use an IFR630N mosfet to dim the screen using a PWM signal:
(looking at top of IFR630N)
gate drain source
gate - 3v3 or 5v signal
drain - comes from gnd of LCD backlight (+LCD backlight is +5v always)
source - goes to gnd
for now use a toggle switch as signal (on/off)
in the future, use a pwm signal from either FPGA or STM32

separate processor to handle the windshield wiper motor:

bk - common
rd - park switch
wt - low speed
bl - high speed
read ohms between bk & rd - when open, wipers are in park position
when closed they are up, either going up or down

monitor input for off/intermitent/low/high
processor monitors the park input (closed when wipers reach park position)

one relay is the 'gate' the other is high/low speed

FPGA: (signals needed so far - some may need to be converted to 5v)

TODO: need a 'recv_gate' signal so STM32 can shutoff/start the 
recv_uart process. And another input to stop the broadcast (or command).
(data_sent signal is not being used - just make it and in instead of an out)

TODO: Also, may want a reference signal generated when the FPGA is running to
blink an LED on the dash to show the FPGA is running. (or in the main box)

TODO: In the StartDefaultTask of freertos.c - wait for a message from the AVR/LCD 
before sending the init_rtlabels/DISPLAY_RTLABELS msg's.

TODO: See if the parallel port can be made bi-directional, that would free up
UART3 on the STM32. (The FPGA can have as many UARTS as there are pins available).

TODO: need a timer in XMEGA processor that turns displays to '0' if no signal 

TODO: 3 or 4 input buttons on dash to int's on STM32
		and 3 or 4 outputs on dash from STM32 for status lights
		
TODO: make text file in EpClient directory that says either "laptop" or "desktop"
	so the client knows which xml file to read from

XMEGA proc for driving LED module (rpm/mph)
The TX's of USART's 1 & 2 go to the LED module (rpm/mph).
2) one is for mph and the other is rpm.
The RX's are interrupt driven. 
Only USART1 RX is used to receive data/cmds from the XMEGA.
The data stream is:
1) 0xFF - header (nothing else in data stream can be 0xFF)
2) low byte of rpm
3) high byte of rpm
4) low byte of mph
5) high byte of mph
6) brightness command (starts at 0xFE - brightest)

The RJ-11 port on LED display box:
BLK - gnd
YEL - rpm/mph serial input
GRN - extra serial input 
RED - 5vdc

pin 32 is 162

2 sep dip's: one on left goes to 3v3 conv board
one on right goes to STM32

start from the left with 5v
	using 14 out of 24 possible:
	10 are from FPGA, 4 of the 3v3 conv ports 
	are used by STM32 for UART1 & UART2
