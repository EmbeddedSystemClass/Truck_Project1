Main Box to house STM32 chip and keypad 

Screen Box has the AVR & LCD screen (in sep. panel to left above red & green buttons)

This box replaces the old monster box which housed the screen, keypad, AVR, PIC24FJ and the FPGA boards.
The main box connects to the screen box via an RS-232 cable using 3v3->5v & RS-232 converters
There is also a PWM wire from the STM32 to the screen box (or use the PWM on from the FPGA)

The AVR and screen work as before and are connected the same, but an STM32 Discovery board replaces the
Microchip PIC24FJ.

The FPGA board will be in another box and will communicate with the Main Box via a serial port and the
same handshacking lines as before. (UART3)

serial ports:

UART1: monitor/TS-7200 (external)
UART2: AVR (external)
UART3: FPGA (external with 2 handshaking lines)

The STM32 has up to 16 ADC channels but the FPGA can be used to do the ADC using support chips.
The FPGA drove the 2 speakers for tones but the STM32 could do this. (keypad tones and alarms)

pinout for LCD:

21) LEDK	| gnd for LCD backlight (not on pinout - wired separately)
20) LEDA	| +5v for  "     "			"				"
19) VEE		goes to gnd threw 20K pot with center tap to VO	
18) FS		font select
17) DATA 7	data lines
16) DATA 6
15) DATA 5
14) DATA 4
13) DATA 3
12) DATA 2
11) DATA 1
10) DATA 0
9) RST		reset signal
8) C/D		command/data
7) CE		chip enable
6) RD		read
5) WR		write
4) VO		goes to center tap of 20k pot
3) VDD		signal +5v
2) VSS		signal gnd
1) FG		frame ground (can go to pin 2)

(all I'm using, currently are 1,4,5,9 & 10)

AVR to t6963:

RST		C2
CD		C3
RD		C4*
DATA0	D2
DATA1	D3
DATA2	D4
DATA3	D5
DATA4	D6
DATA5	D7
DATA6	B0
DATA7	B1

* this one is hidden behind PC3 & PC2 labeled as A2 & A3 on some chips
or labeled as A4 behind reset button on non-pinout end

use an IFR630N mosfet to dim the screen using a PWM signal:
(looking at top of IFR630N)
gate drain source
gate - 3v3 or 5v signal
drain - comes from gnd of LCD backlight (+LCD backlight is +5v always)
source - goes to gnd
for now use a toggle switch as signal (on/off)
in the future, use a pwm signal from either FPGA or STM32
