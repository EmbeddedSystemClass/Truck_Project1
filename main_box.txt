Main Box to house STM32 chip, AVR, LCD screen and keypad

This box replaces the old monster box which housed the screen, keypad, AVR, PIC24FJ and the FPGA boards.

The AVR and screen work as before and are connected the same, but an STM32 Discovery board replaces the
Microchip PIC24FJ.

The FPGA board will be in another box and will communicate with the Main Box via a serial port and the
same handshacking lines as before. (UART3)

serial ports:

UART1: monitor/TS-7200 (external)
UART2: AVR (internal)
UART3: FPGA (external with 2 handshaking lines)

The STM32 has up to 16 ADC channels but the FPGA can be used to do the ADC using support chips.
The FPGA drove the 2 speakers for tones but the STM32 could do this. (keypad tones and alarms)

pinout for LCD:

21) LEDK	| gnd for LCD backlight (not on pinout - wired separately)
20) LEDA	| +5v for  "     "			"				"
19) VEE		goes to gnd threw 20K pot with center tap to VO	
18) FS		font select
17) DATA 7	data lines
16) DATA 6
15) DATA 5
14) DATA 4
13) DATA 3
12) DATA 2
11) DATA 1
10) DATA 0
9) RST		reset signal
8) C/D		command/data
7) CE		chip enable
6) RD		read
5) WR		write
4) VO		goes to center tap of 20k pot
3) VDD		signal +5v
2) VSS		signal gnd
1) FG		frame ground (can go to pin 2)
