TODO: get DS1620 wired up and test with main box

TODO: install behind-backup-cam-monitor board and hook up wires

TODO: install rpm sensor and hookup wires (also rpm wires)

TODO: figure out how to do indoor/outdoor temp with DS1620's

TODO: need a 'recv_gate' signal so STM32 can shutoff/start the 
recv_uart process. And another input to stop the broadcast (or command).
(data_sent signal is not being used - just make it and in instead of an out)

TODO: Also, may want a reference signal generated when the FPGA is running to
blink an LED on the dash to show the FPGA is running. (or in the main box)

TODO: In the StartDefaultTask of freertos.c - wait for a message from the AVR/LCD 
before sending the init_rtlabels/DISPLAY_RTLABELS msg's.

TODO: See if the parallel port can be made bi-directional, that would free up
UART3 on the STM32. (The FPGA can have as many UARTS as there are pins available).

TODO: need a timer in XMEGA processor that turns displays to '0' if no signal 

TODO: 3 or 4 input buttons on dash to int's on STM32
		and 3 or 4 outputs on dash from STM32 for status lights

TODO: figure how to calc trip & odometer and get iobox to save trip to file.



bug: AVR prints some kind of debug msg to location 0.0
