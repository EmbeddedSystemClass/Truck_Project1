new client that runs on Windows 10 laptop compiled with VS2017 using C#

This program duplicates what the client running on linux using ncurses did:

1) send commands to server (io box) to turn on/off relays for starter, ignition & fp, etc.
2) send and receive a copy of the database.
3) connect/disconnect from the server.
4) set the time on the server.
5) get a list of the *.dat files on the server in the /home/dan/dev/sched directory
6) shutdown/reboot the server

The one main difference is that the databases are stored on an sql server on the 
laptop and are manipulated with datasets, tables and data adapters and there is
a grid to view the table. The *.dat files (idata.dat odata.dat) are flat files
that are read by the server to keep track of the io states. Currently the sql
databases only use the odata.dat format (O_DATA).

Current features:
1) a button called 'Send Data' which sends the entire record in 
	the table to the server. 
2) a pull-down list box called 'Update Single Record' which shows a list of the
	labels and sends the current record in the datagrid as just the label, onoff,
	type & time_delay fields.
3) a list of checkboxes on the left to turn on/off the common relays: 
	a) starter
	b) ignition
	c) fuelpump
	d) cooling fan
	e) lights
	f) brights
4) a button which reads an xml file of the table and loads it to the grid
5) a button to show what's in the current database.
6) a button to update the db with what's in the grid

todo:
- option to write current table (in grid or in db) to an xml file
- option to set the time on the server (since there is no rtc yet) (x)
- option to choose which table in the database to:
	a) load to the grid to edit
	b) send to the server
	c) save to xml file
- option to stop the server and have it load either a new database sent over
	using the send data button or load another dat file on the server
